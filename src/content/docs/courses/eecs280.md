So, you're planning on taking EECS280 at some point in the future? Look no further; this document will give you the jumpstart you need to secure an A in this course. 

:::tip[Tl;dr about the course]
EECS280 is titled "Programming and Intro Data Structures". It is comprised of 5 projects over the semester, one midterm and one final exam. It is the stepping stone for all upper level CS courses. The course website is at [eecs280.org](https://eecs280.org/).

## Why take 280

There's the canonical answer that 280 is the gateway to all upper level CS courses at UMich, which is definitely true. CSE, CS-LSA and CE students are required to take this course. But let's say you're not required to take 280. Should you still take it?

Yes you should (if any of the following applies to you):

- You're interested in programming and want to learn more about it in depth
- Need a "back up" skill that will always be in demand
- You want to, at some point, do computational research during and/or after undergrad

Programming is a very universal skill that will always be in demand, no matter how "sideways" markets go. With the tools you learn in 280, you are well on your way to making complex applications that can make in an impact in our society. 

:::caution[But, of course...]
EECS280 is not a "blow-off" course. You can't expect an easy A. This class *is* a time commitment, and so only take it if you're willing to spend time on projects/exams.

## Course Structure

Let's first cover the actual structure of the course: lectures meet twice a week, each for 1.5 hours. Attendance is *not mandatory* for lectures. Labs meet once a week, where attendance **is mandatory** (you get 2 excused absences). Usually, each semester had 3-4 instructors, and ~30 IAs. Labs are taught by the IAs. Office Hours are twofold: instructors host office hours, known as "proffice hours". However, the primary way you will likely get help is in the form of a mix of both virtual and in-person office hours hosted by IAs.

### Grade breakdown

Your final grade in the course is primarily determined by 5 projects (which are virtually the same between semesters) lab attendance, a midterm and a final exam. The 5 projects are:

- P1: Statistics (basics of C++ and testing code)
- P2: Image processing (procedural abstraction)
- P3: Euchre (the "infamous" p3; data structures + debugging)
- P4: Web API (linked lists)
- P5: Machine Learning (BSTs)

We'll go further in depth about these projects later on in this document.

### Good-to-know Policies

Here are some course policies that you should take away from the course syllabus.

- You get 2 labs drops, free of charge. After that, you need to request lab drops from administration.
- Discord is a great place to ask/receive advice on projects *from your peers*. Otherwise, use Piazza.
- There are tutoring resources for EECS280 should you want it (link will update on EECS280 website).
- You might do really well on projects, horrible on exams, calculate a final grade of a C, and *still not pass*. You need at least a 60% average on projects, and 65% on exams to pass.
- The Honor Code checking in this course is one of the harshest. Do NOT break honor code in your projects, you *will* get caught.

## General Advice

This section aims to provide some general advice about the course. Project-specific advice is later on.

### Before taking the course

- Set up your computer for the course. Go to [this link](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/), skip over the "Quick Start", and follow the 3-step "Setup Tutorial".
- Learn how to use a visual debugger! I took this for granted until P4, and I've been thanking myself since for learning it.
- Learn how to use Github. You won't really need this until P2/P3, but it will be useful to learn ahead of time. Read [this tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_git.html). 
- Find at least one other person taking 280 in the same semester you are, so you can help each other learn lecture content.

### During the course

- Do NOT forget to attend labs. They're a great way to reinforce lecture content.
- Hate in-person lectures? I do too. [Thanks, Professor Juett](https://jamesjuett.github.io/eecs280-async-lectures/).
- Use [lobster.eecs](https://lobster.eecs.umich.edu/) to visualize small snippets of code like you would with a debugger.
