:::note
This is not the main MES website! The main website is under construction, but once it's ready it can be found at [muslimeng.org](https://muslimeng.org)

:::

Let's quickly recap what this site is. This is the MES docs, an active knowledgebase for everything MES and Michigan Engineering related. It includes a pool of student and alumni-written resources that can range from MES events + happenings to class information and testimonials. Information for contributing can be found on the ["How to Contribute"](/welcome/how-to-contribute) page.

## Our Vision

As you can guess, this website will always be work in progress. The premise of having a place where absolutely everything is compiled is to keep records of it. There are times where multiple people may have the same question about the same course, and so it will become tedious to re-answer the questions within the [Whatsapp chats](/the-docs/socials#chats). We've created the MES docs with two goals in mind:

### Crowdsourcing

The best advice comes from the people who have experienced something first hand. Say what you will about resources like Atlas and RMP; they don't give you the nitty gritty like students who have completed the course. However, to be able to compile these resources, we depend on our members to contribute and take the time to assist new and current students. We also see this as a great opportunity to get the community involved in something that will be long lasting!

### Collaborative Success

As engineers, one of our motivating pillars is to make the world a better place for the future. This is no different! Michigan Engineering is definitely one of the toughest engineering schools in the US, and even internationally! Students come here not only for the community, but to gain a unique set of tools that can be applied to so many situations in the future. Thus, this site acts as a pool of tools that can make future (and prospective!) students be drawn to and utilize everything that UofM has to offer.

## Jump Right In!

We hope this collection of resources will prove to be useful to you, and that you will consider contributing for the betterment of our future members/Michigan Engineers as a whole!
